In the diagram, we have entities and relationships. Entities are represented within squares, while relationships are illustrated using directed arrows. The entities can be classified into the following categories:
- <span style="background:#BAC8D3">given data</span>: Data that is usually given at outbreak onset.
- <span style="background:#B2C9AB">wanted data</span>: Target data to obtain through the investigation.
- <span style="background:#E1D5E7">pre-collectable data</span>: Data that can be collected before outbreak onset.
- <span style="background:#FFF2CC">derived data</span>: Data discovered during the investigation leading to further insights and potential actions.
- <span style="background: #FAD7AC">supportive data</span>: Data collected specifically during an outbreak but not the primary target data.
