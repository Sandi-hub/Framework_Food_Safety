Time Aspects include:
- Onset of illness of each case
- Duration of the outbreak
- Season in which the outbreak happens

Different types of outbreaks can be characterized by the duration, frequency and timing of exposure: 
- Point Source Outbreak: all the exposures to the infectious agent or toxin occur within a brief, well-defined period of time. This might happen during an event, such as a meal at a restaurant where food contaminated with a pathogen is served, or through a single batch of tainted product that is consumed over a short duration.
- Continuous Source Outbreak: exposure to the infectious agent or toxin continues over an extended period. This might be due to a contaminated water supply, ongoing infection control issues in a healthcare setting, or prolonged availability of a contaminated food product in the market.
