title: Welcome to the Framework for Food Safety Investigations

This framework systematically outlines potential investigative pathways and pinpoints relevant data sources for identifying contaminated food items and their origins during foodborne disease outbreaks. In the diagram below most entities and relations are clickable and point towards explanations and literature in the folder "Framework Cards". Within those files links point to additional background information stored in the folder "Knowledge Cards".
